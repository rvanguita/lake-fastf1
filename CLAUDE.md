# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A long-term data engineering / ML project for Formula 1 data. It pulls race and session results with the FastF1 library, runs them through a Raw → Bronze → Silver medallion pipeline (Parquet → Delta Lake, transformed with PySpark/SQL), trains a championship-prediction model tracked in MLflow, and serves predictions through a FastAPI service consumed by a Streamlit dashboard. Orchestration is Apache Airflow.

## Commands

Root project uses `uv` (Python >=3.13). `app/api`, `app/streamlit` and `app/dash` are separate `uv` projects with their own `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
# Install root deps
uv sync

# Lint (ruff, no repo-specific config — uses defaults)
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .

# Run the whole stack (Airflow :8080, FastAPI :5002, Streamlit :8501, Dash :8050)
docker compose up --build -d

# Run pipeline stages locally/ad hoc (each module has a __main__)
uv run python -m src.extract_data      # FastF1 -> data/raw (Parquet)
uv run python -m src.spark_session     # Bronze: consolidate Raw parquet -> Delta
uv run python -m src.silver_data       # Silver: champions, driver_statistic_*, driver_all_statistic, tb_abt
uv run python -m src.train_driver_champion  # train model, log to MLflow

# Airflow (DAG lives in dags/data_pipeline.py, dag_id="data-pipeline")
# When run via docker compose, AIRFLOW_HOME is /opt/airflow/project/.airflow
# and the DAGs folder is /opt/airflow/project/dags (repo root mounted at /opt/airflow/project)

# Tests (pytest). Four separate suites — each its own uv project:
uv run pytest                              # root: src/ (tests/)
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
(cd app/api && uv run pytest)              # FastAPI routes (app/api/tests/)
(cd app/streamlit && uv run pytest)        # dashboard pandas helpers (app/streamlit/tests/)
(cd app/dash && uv run --locked pytest)    # analytics, Delta/API contracts, pages and callbacks
```

The test suites are deliberately infra-free: FastF1 (network), Spark/Delta (JVM), MLflow, MySQL
and S3 are all mocked or replaced with `tmp_path`, so `pytest` runs in seconds. What's covered:

- **root (`tests/`)** — `ExtractData` (FastF1 mocked), `sender_local.find_delta_tables` /
  `create_mysql_engine`, `sender.Sender` (S3 client mocked), `spark_save_table`'s Delta
  write-chain (mock DataFrame), and `silver_data.read_sql_file` + the `.format()` brace-safety
  contract of every file in `src/queries/`.
- **`app/api/tests/`** — the FastAPI routes, model mocked via `main.model_find`.
- **`app/streamlit/tests/`** — the pandas-only helpers: `compute_*`, `format_color`, `_rank_by`,
  `_color_map`, `get_id_predictions`.

**Not** covered: the actual SQL transformations / Silver Spark execution (only the query files'
`.format()` safety is smoke-checked, not what they compute), the DAG, and the training script.
`app/api` and `app/streamlit` set `[tool.uv] package = false` (not built as wheels); their
`[dependency-groups].dev` adds `pytest` (and `httpx`, for the API's `TestClient`). `app/api` is
a single `main.py`; `app/streamlit` is `main.py` + `data.py` + `analytics.py` + `charts.py`
(the tests import `analytics` / `data` directly).

CI: `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs on every `push` and `pull_request` — a quality job
(`uvx ruff@0.16.2 check .` and `format --check .`) plus a `pytest` matrix (one job per uv project,
`uv run --locked pytest -q`). `setup-uv` is pinned to `0.12.0` to match the root `uv_build`
constraint; ruff is pinned to `0.16.2` (matches the root dep).

Each app has its own Dockerfile and is built independently by `docker-compose.yml`:
- `app/api` — FastAPI service, own `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`
- `app/streamlit` — Streamlit dashboard, own `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`
- `app/dash` — independent Race Control dashboard, own `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`; Gunicorn container

`.devcontainer/` (VS Code, "Python 3.13 and Java 17") is the one place the Spark/Delta stages
run without extra setup — it presets `JAVA_HOME` and `PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS` and forwards Jupyter
(8888) and the Spark UI (4040). Outside it (or `docker compose`), the Bronze/Silver stages need
a local JVM + Java 17.

Root `main.py` and `src/lake_fastf1/__init__.py` (and the `lake-fastf1` console script) are
leftover `uv init` scaffolding — the real code is in `src/*.py`, `dags/`, and `app/`.

## Environment variables

Config is entirely via env vars (loaded from `.env`, which is gitignored — the tracked template is `.env.example`; copy it to `.env` and fill in the blanks). Every pipeline module (`src/*.py`) reads required paths via `os.environ[...]` and will raise `KeyError` if unset — always run through `docker compose` or with `.env` sourced.

Key vars: `PATH_RAW`, `PATH_BRONZE`, `PATH_SILVER`, `PATH_QUERIES` (data lake layer paths + SQL directory), `MLFLOW_URI`, `MLFLOW_MODEL_REGISTERED`, `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME`, `API_PORT`, `MYSQL_HOST`/`MYSQL_PORT`/`MYSQL_USER`/`MYSQL_PASSWORD`/`MYSQL_ID_TABLE` (used by `src/sender_local.py` to mirror Bronze/Silver Delta tables into MySQL), `AWS_KEY`/`AWS_SECRET_KEY` (used by `src/sender.py` for S3 upload of raw Parquet files).

The Streamlit container additionally uses `TABLE_PATH_SILVER` and `TABLE_PATH_BRONZE` (paths as mounted read-only inside that container, not the same as `PATH_SILVER`/`PATH_BRONZE`) and reaches the API at `http://api-driver-champion:{API_PORT}` (Docker Compose service name), not localhost. `API_URL` can override that address for local execution.

## Architecture

### Data pipeline layers

The DAG (`dags/data_pipeline.py`, `formula_one_data_pipeline`) wires these stages with Airflow `Asset`s as inlets/outlets, so lineage is explicit: `raw >> bronze >> silver >> sender_mysql`.

1. **Raw** (`src/extract_data.py`, `ExtractData`): pulls each year/round/session (identifiers `"R"` race, `"S"` sprint) from FastF1, flattens session results into a DataFrame, and writes one Parquet file per `{year}_{round:02}_{identifier}.parquet` under `PATH_RAW/results`. Skips files that already exist unless `reload_data=True` (which backfills from 1980 to present). Sleeps between requests to be polite to the FastF1/Ergast backend.

2. **Bronze** (`src/spark_session.py`, `consolidate_data`): reads all Raw Parquet files with Spark and overwrites the Delta table at `PATH_BRONZE/results`. `spark_session()` and `spark_save_table()` here are the shared Spark/Delta helpers used by the Silver layer too; writes preserve Spark's partitioning unless `output_partitions` is explicitly supplied.

3. **Silver** (`src/silver_data.py`, `SilverData`): loads SQL from `PATH_QUERIES/*.sql` (via `src/queries/`) and runs it against Spark SQL temp views created from Bronze/Silver Delta tables. Produces:
   - `champions` (`champions.sql`) — one row per year: the points leader, `rank_driver`.
   - `driver_statistic_{5,10,20,40,50}` (`driver_statistic.sql`, parameterized by `{last_rounds}`) — rolling-window driver stats as of each `dt_ref` (one row per date a session happened), looking back N rounds, split into overall/Race/Sprint metrics. This is the most complex query in the repo — it builds a per-date "as of" rolling window from `results`, not simple groupby aggregates.
   - `driver_all_statistic` (`consolidate_drivers_statistic`) — inner-joins all five `driver_statistic_N` tables together on `(dt_ref, DriverId)`, suffixing every metric column with its window size (`_5`, `_10`, ...) via `add_suffix`.
   - `tb_abt` (`tb_abt.sql`) — the model's analytical base table: `driver_all_statistic` left-joined to `champions` to produce the `flChampion` label (was this driver champion that year, as of that `dt_ref`).

4. **MySQL mirror** (`src/sender_local.py`, `send_layer_to_mysql`): walks a layer's directory (Bronze or Silver) for `_delta_log` subfolders (i.e. every Delta table under that layer), reads each with Spark, converts to pandas, and replaces the corresponding MySQL table (named `{MYSQL_ID_TABLE}_{relative_path_with_underscores}`). This is how downstream/BI consumers outside the Spark/Delta world get the data.

5. **S3 upload** (`src/sender.py`, standalone CLI, not wired into the DAG): uploads all `*.parquet` files from a local folder to S3 and deletes them locally afterward — a separate archival path for Raw data, run manually via `python -m src.sender --bucket ...`.

All Silver SQL files are read as raw strings and `.format()`-ed (not parameterized queries) — `driver_statistic.sql` uses `{year_start}`, `{year_stop}`, `{last_rounds}` placeholders. If you edit these queries, curly braces anywhere in the SQL (e.g. in comments) will break `.format()`.

### Model training

`src/train_driver_champion.py` reads `tb_abt` from Silver, filters the current/incomplete season in Spark before collecting to pandas, performs rolling-origin backtests, fits a `SimpleImputer` + `RandomForestClassifier` pipeline, calibrates probabilities and logs the model plus model card to MLflow. Feature selection is name-based through `NON_FEATURES`, so column order is not part of the contract. MLflow 3 saves sklearn models in **skops** format and only reopens the types listed in `SKOPS_TRUSTED_TYPES` (passed to `log_model`); add any new custom/tree type there, and keep the `__main__` block importing `main` from `src.train_driver_champion` so custom classes are serialized under an importable module.

### Serving layer

- **`app/api/main.py`** (FastAPI): serves `MLFLOW_MODEL_REGISTERED`. `model_find` caches the loaded model for `MODEL_CACHE_TTL` seconds and logs the real load error (routes still answer 500 "Model not found"). `_load_local_model` opens skops models with the `MLmodel` trusted types plus `MODEL_SKOPS_TRUSTED_TYPES` (default `sklearn.tree._tree.Tree`), so models saved under an older skops keep loading. The image installs `uv.lock` (`uv sync --frozen`); unpinned installs once pulled a newer skops that rejected the registered model. `POST /v1/predict` normalizes candidates per snapshot and accepts `include_intervals` (default `true`); disabling it skips member-level ensemble scoring. The legacy `/predict` contract remains unchanged.

- **`app/streamlit/`** (dashboard) — reads Delta with season predicates and column projection, keyed by the current Delta version so caches refresh after a table update. Each page loads only its own dependencies; Campeonato and Comparador never call the prediction API. `load_predictions(year)` requests point estimates without ensemble intervals and degrades safely when the API or ABT is unavailable.

### Dash interface

`app/dash/` (Race Control) is a Dash Pages app independent of Streamlit: `pages/`
holds `temporada` (`/`), `corridas`, `previsao` and `eras`, each a `layout(**query)`
rendered server-side from URL params (`?ano=`, `?de=&ate=`) plus small targeted
callbacks. `analytics.py` is pure pandas (results cleaning + findings),
`figures.py` registers the `race_control` Plotly template, `components.py` holds
shared UI, `repository.py` does projected/predicate Delta reads cached by table
version (60 s TTL) and is resolved via `get_repository()` / `set_repository()` so
tests inject a fake. Only the forecast callback calls the API. `dcc.Graph` uses
`responsive=True`, so chart height must come from its `style`, never the figure.
Run with `uv run --project app/dash python app/dash/main.py` (port 8050).

### Spark/Delta conventions

- `spark_save_table()` performs a full overwrite with schema replacement but does not force `coalesce(1)`; `output_partitions` is available for explicit control. There is still no merge/upsert processing.
- Each Airflow task owns and closes its `SparkSession`; the five rolling-statistic windows share one session and a cached Bronze view within their task.
- Delta tables are read into Spark SQL via `createOrReplaceTempView`, so all Silver transformations are plain Spark SQL against `PATH_QUERIES/*.sql`, not DataFrame API chains.

### Airflow specifics

- The DAG uses the Airflow 3 SDK style (`from airflow.sdk import Asset, dag, task, task_group`), decorator-based tasks, and explicit `Asset` inlets/outlets for data lineage between Raw/Bronze/Silver/MySQL stages — not the classic `DAG()`/`PythonOperator` style.
- Scheduled weekly (`schedule="0 0 * * 1"`, i.e. Monday), `catchup=False`, `max_active_runs=1`.
- The Airflow image (root `Dockerfile`) installs `requirements.txt` via pip, not `uv sync` — the `uv`-based install is present but commented out. Keep `requirements.txt` and root `pyproject.toml` dependencies in sync when adding packages needed by DAG tasks.
